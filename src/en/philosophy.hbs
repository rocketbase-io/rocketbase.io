                        <p class="text-faded">We organize ourselves with agile software development techniques and use
                            methods like kanban and scrum.
                            This enables our customers to be closed involved in the development process. These methods
                            provide an overview of the current status and work done at all times.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We work with short iterations that run through planning, development, testing and
                            deployment. The length of each iteration depends on the project and the timeline
                            of the whole project. Changes in requirements are possible at all times and will be planned
                            between each cycle.
                        </p>
                        <p>Our software is written from the beginning with automated tests, so that we can
                            guarantee to always have a mature product that can go online. We believe in constantly
                            deploying small changes instead of big bangs every two weeks, this will minimize
                            the risk of failure due to flaws in the software. We have a continuous deployment
                            infrastructure, whereby each adjustment immediately is getting deployed on our test
                            environment and can then easily continue to go live in production.</p>
                        <p>We have a number of mature microservices
                            covering for example an user management, mobile payment, asset management modules.
                            They entitle us to setup prototypes in a very short time, invaluable for young startups to
                            convince
                            decider and investors of their product idea.
